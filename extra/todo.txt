List of Remaining Tasks:

    -------
    inserts -- COMPLETED
    -------

XX Implement New Project adding Task & Task Skill entities (and getting this info from user) XX
    currently it just makes a project entity

    doing task: COMPLETED (took a bit longer than expected)

XX Implement Search & Assign (Revamp GUI & Backend)
    this is more complex than I initially though, since we need to make a new assignment
    entry, and link to a task_skill entity

    I also need to find out if we need to provide options for this or if the user can enter
    the info themselves (would simplify things a good bit if they could)

    doing task: COMPLETED (also took a second)

    ------------
    transactions -- COMPLETED
    ------------

XX Implement Logging Work Time
    need to move this to the button under the transactions menu, and can simplify 
    what the button does a good amount. Just need to ask for employee ID & update the worklog table
    should be relatively simple

    doing task: COMPLETED

XX Implement Create Bill functionality & GUI
    Need to implement the create bill button in the transactions menu
    Enter a date --> check if there is an existing bill (if not make one)
    --> Calculate bill amount (or get it if we store it) & add to table
    Not super complicated

    doing task: COMPLETED

    -------
    reports -- COMPLETED
    -------

XX Project Schedule Report
    need both the GUI formatting to be made & the SQL queries to be linked
    (and made if they haven't been already).
    
    needs to be able to show all projects or 1 specific project

    can have repeating entries in a table for all proejcts (doesn't have to look pretty)

     doing task: COMPLETED


XX EmpSkill Report
    need to add ability to display by all or employee, currently
    only displaying by all. (have a menu to select which one)
    should be pretty simple
    
    doing task: COMPLETED


XX Assignment Form 
    needs to be displayable by project, employee, or all (have a menu/buttons to decide)
    same as project report, can have repeating entries & doesn't have to be pretty
    just display the data

    doing task: COMPLETED


XX Work Log Report
    needs to be displayable by project, employee, or all (have a menu/buttons to decide)
    again same as proj & assignment reports, doesn't have to be pretty, just get the data out there

    doing task: COMPLETED


--Re-Do Seed Data 
    needs to not reference any hard coded variables for things that can be selected from tables

    Also need to fix what we got wrong in proj 3 (mostly just getting rid of hard coded stuff)
    Maybe re-organize? Thats low priority though as long as it works & has no hard coded stuff 
    that we will get marked off for.

    doing task:

--Comment, Test,  & Clean Up Code 
    do this last (obviously comment what you can when you write it), clean up stuff
    before submitting

    Test all the functionality sometime before the demo on wed/fri

    doing task: Joey & Kenny
